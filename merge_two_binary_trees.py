Explanation to the if not statements at the very top of the merge_trees function. 
If the first_tree or second_tree is None, we append the whole branch given any level in the merged tree. 

E.g., given the scenario below: 
 
                first_tree:    second_tree:               merged_tree: 
                     2              1                          3  
                    /                \                        / \
                   5                 18                      5   18 
                  /                    \Â                    /     \

Since the first_tree has no right branch, we will return the whole branch of the second tree, and vice versa.
